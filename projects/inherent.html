                            <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;">
                                Inherent Resolve was developed as a part of Teknack 2018 (an online gaming festival). It is a simple action game
                                based on Syrian Civil War. Inherent Resolve is the name of the mission currently being undertaken by the allied forces
                                to destroy ISIS hideouts.
                            </p><br>
                            <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;">
                                The game features a helicopter and multiple terrorist hideouts. The player has to bomb the terrorist hideouts and score points.
                                The best feature which also makes the game different from other games on Teknack is that the character (helicopter) can be 
                                controlled (apart from keyboard) by a touch interface which can be opened in any mobile browser. 
                            </p><br>
                            <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;">
                                The mobile and PC instance can be linked with each other by a randomly generated passcode shown to the user. On successfull
                                connection, the characters can be controlled by the mobile remotely.
                            </p>

                            <h5>Role & Contribution</h5>
                            <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;">
                                I was the sole developer of the game. All the features mentioned were entirely coded by me.
                            </p>
                            <h5>Learning Experience</h5>
                            <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;">
                                I already had experience developing games using Phaser.js as the game engine and Node-Express-MongoDB as the backend.
                                Nothing new learned here. But in my previous games, I had used Ajax to send data between the client and server. But, in this
                                project I needed a realtime communication mechanism to control the characters. 
                            </p><br>
                            <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;">
                                I chose Socket.io for this purpose. I had to go through a lot of tutorials to understand it's working. First, I just built a
                                simple chat application so as to learn Socket.io. Based on that, I was finally successfull in coding the remote realtime
                                controls.
                            </p><br>
                            <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;">
                                This was my first encounter with Socket.io and I'm glad that I learned it since it has come to my use in other projects as well.
