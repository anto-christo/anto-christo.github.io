                            <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;">
                                Communication between college admins/faculties and students generally happen through WhatsApp. However, in most
                                cases these are not direct communications since all notices are first passed on to the respective class representatives
                                and the class representatives forward it to the class groups. This process is sometimes quite time consuming
                                and also there is probability of important notices getting lost among other informal talks in the group.
                            </p><br>
                            <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;">
                                We proposed this idea of having a messaging application through which notices can be directly sent
                                to a class of students. For eg: If a professor wants to send a notice to Second Year students of the Computer
                                department, all the professor has to do is type the message, select the departments-years to which the message has
                                to be sent and that's it. All the students who have downloaded the app (which is going to be compulsory) will receive
                                an instant notification of the message in the application much like Whatsapp.
                            </p>

                            <h5>Role & Contribution</h5>
                            <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;">
                                I was the team leader and also one out of the 5 developers. A leader always leads by example and
                                hence I put the best of my efforts to develop maximum features of the app and also make sure other
                                team mates are doing their job. Following are the features that I contributed: 
                                <ul>
                                    <li>1. Authentication (Login/Register).</li>
                                    <li>2. Send and receive messages.</li>
                                    <li>3. Send messages to multiple classes at once.</li>
                                    <li>4. Notification on receiving messages.</li>
                                    <li>5. Uploading and downloading attached files.</li>
                                </ul>
                            </p>
                            <h5>Learning Experience</h5>
                            <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;">
                                It was a requirement put forth by the college to make the app cross-platform so that maximum number
                                of students can benefit from it. Hence, we chose <a href="https://phonegap.com/" target="_blank">Phonegap</a> as our development platform
                                due to it's popularity and community support. But, Phonegap was entirely a new thing for me and as expected, 
                                there were lot of hiccups at the initial stages of development.
                            </p><br>
                            <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;">
                                Getting the notification to work with <a href="https://firebase.google.com/docs/cloud-messaging/" target="_blank">Firebase Cloud Messaging</a> was one of the most difficult tasks. It required
                                a lot of research and time. The second most toughest was to upload and download files, the Cardova library to do this was deprecated 
                                and hence had to code this part in vanilla JavaScript and make it compatible with Phonegap. Using <a href="https://framework7.io/" target="_blank">Framework7</a> for the frontend was
                                quite simple and it did not give any headaches.
                            </p><br>
                            <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;">
                                Another important part was the leadership experience, this was the first time I was leading a live project and hence took extra precautions
                                so as to not unknowingly play unfair with any of the team mates. I made sure every team mate was assigned equal amount of work
                                and ensured they received all support and help from my end.
                            </p><br>
                            <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;">
                                In all, developing an application like Bling gave me a much required expereince in the field of cross-platform mobile application
                                developement and experience of leading a team.
