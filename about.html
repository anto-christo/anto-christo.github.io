                                            If I know how to do it, I'll get started with it right away. If I don't know how to do it, I'll learn and 
                                            then get started with it right away. As a programmer, I don't let any language to be my barrier, I can work

                                Hi, my name is Anto Christopher. I'm a final year Bachelor of Computer Engineering
                                student from Don Bosco Institute of Technology, Mumbai University.
                            </p><br>
                            <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;">
                                I've immense interest in coding softwares and that is what I spend most of my time on. For the 
                                past couple of years, I've been developing web and mobile applications as my side projects.
                                I host most of these projects on GitHub to do my bit for the Open Source community.
                                These projects cannot be counted as 'Open Source products' that are very useful to the community.
                                But I'm sure, the codes that I have written will act as a reference/help for my fellow Open Source developers
                                in building similar and better Open Source products.
                            </p><br>
                            <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;">
                                All these years I've been only coding and hosting my projects on GitHub. Lately, I've also started 
                                exploring and contributing to other Open Source projects. 
                                I've nothing much to say in this regard but I'm working towards becoming a major contributor to the Open Source 
                                community. 
                            </p><br>
                            <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;">
                                Apart from coding, I spend my leisure time by watching Stand Up comedy videos on YouTube, reading and writing 
                                answers on Quora, scrolling through Twitter and watching WWE (PS: I know that WWE matches are pre-planned and everything that happens is based on 
                                storylines.)
                            </p><br>
                        </div>
                        <div class="col m2"></div>
                        <div class="col m5">
                            <span class="card-title">What I'm good at ?</span>
                            <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;">
                                I'm good at driving cars. Sounds odd? Were you expecting me to say I'm good at programming
                                and love to code in so and so langauge? Well, that's how I view programming as, it's like driving
                                a car.
                            </p><br>
                            <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;">
                                When you say you know to drive a car, it means you can drive any car irrespective of the brand, model or type
                                . Well at first you need some time to get accustomed to a particular car but once you get the hold, you are good
                                to go.
                            </p><br>
                            <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;">
                                Some cars have automatic transmission and features that reduce the work of the driver, while some 
                                have manual transmission and features that require extra work from the driver. In both cases, you just need
                                to read the manual and find out what type of controls the car offers.
                            </p><br>
                            <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;">
                                It's the same case with programming languages. When you say you know to code, you can code 
                                in any language with some initial practice. Some languages are like cars with automatic transmission
                                (Love you Javascript !!) that reduce your work while some are like cars with manual transmission (Hate you Java !!).
                                Again, in both cases you just need to read the manual (documentation) for you to get control over it.
