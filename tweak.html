                                English communication has always haunted the engineers of our country. There have been instances wherin even a highly skilled
                                candidate has been rejected a job just because of his poor communication skills. Tweak app by Tweak Academy is an attempt to
                                help potential candidates to improve their communication skills.
                            </p><br>
                            <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;">
                                The app consists of three modules: A grammar module, a vocabulary module and a pronunciation module.
                                There are many apps in the market that intend to solve the above problem. However, Tweak stands apart due to it's 
                                interactive nature and mainly due to it's content. The content has been tailored specifically for engineering students
                                by specially appointed content writers.

                                This project is closed source and is owned by Tweak Academy and hence cannot reveal much details.

                            <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;">
                                I was one of the 11 developers. I was responsible for developing the entire Grammar module along with a 
                                co-developer. Cannot detail out the individual features that I developed since it's going to be launched
                                as a premium closed source application.
                            </p>
                            <h5>Learning Experience</h5>
                            <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;">
                                The best experience with Tweak was learning to code in React Native. React Native is the talk of the town and 
                                I'm glad I got the oppurtunity to work it. Learning React Native was not so easy as I was unaware of ES6 syntax
                                on which most of the React Native codebase is based on. So, I took this opportunity to learn ES6 as well and then jumped deep into React Native.
                                The thing I liked the most about React Native is the speed of development and component-based coding.
                            </p><br>
                            <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;">
                                In the first month of the project, we wrote ZERO lines of operational code. We had decided to use DynamoDB as our database
                                since we wanted to host the app on Amazon Web Services. Since, DynamoDB is developed and maintained by Amazon, we expected better
                                integration, that may have been the case but we never reached there.
                            </p><br>
                            <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;">
                                The reason being, integarting React Native and DynamoDB was a humongous task for us. There was no proper NPM package for the purpose
                                and all our attempts failed. Finally we decided to go with SQL database and PHP for the backend hosted on an AWS Ubuntu instance.
